#XTORIUM SOURCE CODE

## Introduction
Xtorium. Best web browser available for everyone. Personal, so the user got all the power on the software.

## First of all
Xtorium hasn't been developped for years and is now obselete. If you want to develop Xtorium and update it, please do so.

## Getting Started
1.	Installation process: Just download it and copy the project directory to somewhere clean.
2.	Software dependencies: Does not require any additional software.
3.	Latest release: **Version 18.63.3.2**
4.	API references: Needs CefSharp.Winform (currently version 75, see [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp)).

## Build and Test
Latest versions only run on x64 computers, so if you want a maximum compatibility with Cefsharp, debug on x64.

## Browser features
Xtorium has all the functionnalities that any other web browser has. But some aren't working or aren't finished.

## Apps
These are "apps" that run inside the web browser eco-system. These can be special apps written for Xtorium or even just progressive web apps. Some exemples are Office Online Apps (Word Online, Powerpoint Online, Excel Online, ...), Twitter, ...

## Contribute
Always do things that help the user such as creating new features, new apps, bugs solutions, and so on... And also by giving the user power, without removing existing features.
Or create a custom version of the browser. BUT please, let me know what you have done, it's always great to see people's work!

Thanks and have fun.
