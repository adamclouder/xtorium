# Introduction
Xtorium. Best web browser available for eveyone. Personal, so the user got all the power on the software.

# Getting Started
1.	Installation process : Just download it and copy the project directory to somewhere clean.
2.	Software dependencies : Does not require any additional software.
3.	Latest release : Version 18.63.3.2
4.	API references : Needs CefSharp.Winform (currently version 63).

# Build and Test
Last versions only run on x64 computers, so if you want a maximum compatibility, debug on x64.

# Contribute
Allways do things that help the user such as creating new features, new apps, bugs solutions, and so on... And also by giving the user power, without removing existing features.
Or create a custom version of the browser. BUT please, let me know what you have done, it's always great to see people's work.

Thanks.
